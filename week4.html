       &nbsp; Read Wei et al. (2019) and
Spremic and Simunic (2018) and then post a message that reflects your thoughts and responses to the

In your responses, consider the following questions: <br>
<ul>
    <li>What is a 'fully digital enterprise'?</li>
       <li>What are the cyber Security challenges/concerns with a fully digital enterprise?</li>
       <li>What are the cyber security challenges for a bricks and mortar SME wanting to become a digital enterprise?</li>
        <li>Do you agree with the views expressed, especially in light of the 'energy crisis'
        experienced worldwide in 2022?</li>
        </li>

<h1 class="text-center">Possible Answers</h1>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A fully digital enterprise is one that has been transformed digitally and fully incorporate digital tools and 
    technologies across all aspects of their operations.
</li> <br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Cyber threat is a major concern when we are looking at challenges, because digital enterprises perform operation 
     digitally they can be put out of work if they are attacked . <br>
     “Most organizations in all sectors of industry, commerce and government are fundamentally dependent on their information systems (IS) and 

     would quickly cease to function <br> should the technology
      (preferably information technology  – IT and recently novel digital technologies)”(Wei et al and Spremic, 2019)

</li><br>

<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 	<b>Employee behavior:</b>  Be it using weak passwords, falling victim to social engineering, because if cyber attack wasn’t intended vulnerabilities would attract attacks</li>
<li>- Lack of Knowledge and Expertise- As a company moves more of its operations online, its employees may need to develop new skills and knowledge to maintain security. This could include areas such as cloud security, network security, and incident response.</li>
 <li>   - Limited Resources- SMEs often have limited budgets and personnel, which can make it difficult to implement and maintain robust security measures. This may include everything from firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, to incident response plans and threat intelligence,</li>
 <li>   - Complex Systems and Integration- as a company expands its use of digital systems and technologies, it can become more difficult to secure all its assets and to understand where the vulnerabilities and risks might lie. Additionally, all systems need to be integrated and aligned, which can be challenging and costly.</li>
 <li>   - Data Governance- As more data is collected, stored, and processed digitally, SMEs must ensure that they comply with data protection regulations and keep their data safe. This includes protecting customer and employee data, as well as dealing with data breaches in a timely manner</li>
