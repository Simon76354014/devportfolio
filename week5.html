    <h1>Tips to protect your application</h1><br><br>
  <ol>
    <li>
        Security scanning
        As the foundation of any security solution, vulnerability scanning provides much-needed oversight. This is a first line of defense,
        as it reveals where key vulnerabilities exist and whether any urgent threats need to be addressed.
        
    </li><br><br>
    <li> <h4>Encryption</h4> 
        The need for strong encryption cannot be overstated. After all, the latest version of the OWASP Top 10 includes a revised category 
        focused exclusively on cryptographic failures. SSL certificates remain the standard for producing encrypted links between clients
         and servers.</li><br><br>
    <li><h4>Log files</h4> 
        OWASP cites security logging as one of the most impactful strategies for verifying current security and boosting protection moving 
        forward. Logging is available for everything from network devices and web servers to database servers and even custom application
         events. These logs are especially valuable for identifying and monitoring security incidents and policy violations.</li><br><br>
    <li><h4>Authorization</h4> 
        Defined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as "the process of verifying that a requested action or service is 
        approved for a specific entity," authorization should not be confused with authentication. The former simply reveals whether users have
         access rights. The aforementioned principle of least privilege applies here, but a deny-by-default mentality must also be implemented.
          Simply put, this means that all traffic that's not explicitly permitted must be denied.</li><br><br>
    <li><h4>Authentication</h4> 
        Confirming that all individuals or entities are, in fact, who they claim to be, authentication processes verify identity and, ideally,
         will ensure that the most problematic parties are denied access. User IDs and passwords are the core components of modern 
         authentication. OWASP also recommends Transport Layer Security (TLS) for login pages, as well as re-authentication to prevent
          session hijacking or cross-site request forgery.</li>
  </ol> 
    

  <h1>Reflections:</h1>
  The material is a helpful overview of the top 10 OWASP vulnerabilities, highlighting typical security problems and providing helpful
   advice for reducing them. Developers and website owners 
  who wish to improve the security of their online applications and defend against potential assaults can use it as a starting point. <br><br>
